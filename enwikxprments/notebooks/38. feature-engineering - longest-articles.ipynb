The team\\'s swagger was cemented by \"The Superbowl Shuffle,\" a music video made by the team that became a huge hit on the music charts.

It was not a short war, nor a long war, as it lasted 6 years, from 1768 to 1774.

Lake Clifton Eastern High School was built sometime in the 1970s. It is currently the largest and newest school in the entire city. It\\'s been said that Lake Clifton Eastern High School is the largest high school in terms of physical size on the East Coast. When Lake Clifton first opened, it was said that it was the largest high school in the entire nation. Lake Clifton Eastern obtained its name through a place location and from another school. When Lake Clifton Eastern High School first opened, it was simply known as Lake Clifton High School, the school was built on top of a lake known as Lake Clifton, there are some fears in the current time that the school is sinking each year due to the fact the school was built on top of a lake. In 1985, Eastern High School moved into Lake Clifton and merged with Lake Clifton, the Baltimore City School Board decided to change the name to Lake Clifton Eastern High School to reflect Eastern\\'s merge with Lake Clifton. In 1997 a electrical fire destroyed the library of Lake Clifton Eastern High School, soon after, a state of the art media center was built. Lake Clifton\\'s library is the newest in the whole city. Lake Clifton\\'s sports teams (as of the 2002-2003 school year) included wrestling, swimming, track and field, basketball, football, and tennis. A decision was made in 2003 by the city school board to split up Lake Clifton into a smaller school, a trend that is occuring throughout the city school system with large high schools. Within the next few years, Lake Clifton Eastern High School will cease to exist as Lake Clifton Eastern High School. )</em></li>\\n<li>00:35, 23 Nov 2003 [[User:Angela|Angela]] deleted \"Talk:Henning\" <em>(content was \"skal det skje noe her\" (do be about facts be made any here))</em></li>\\n<li>00:33, 23 Nov 2003 [[User:Kingturtle|Kingturtle]] deleted \"Komplett\" <em>(content was: \\'www.Komplett.noThe biggest online shop in North Europe.\\')</em></li>\\n<li>00:28, 23 Nov 2003 [[User:Angela|Angela]] deleted \"Pearls before swine\" <em>(Listed on [[Wikipedia:Things to be moved to Wiktionary]] for 3 months.

The team\\'s cocky demeanor and dominating play captivated the whole nation, earning the title \"America\\'s Team\" from the Dallas Cowboys.  The Team lost only won game, against Miami on Monday Night.  That game was one of the most watched Monday night games in history.  The Bears swept into the playoffs in triumph, not giving up a single point in both playoff games, a NFL reford.  They also won the Halas Trophy for the NFC Championship, the first time it was given (the trophy was named after former team owner and coach Geroge Halas, one of the greatest football coaches ever.)  They then destroyed the New England Patriots 46-10 in the most one-sided Super Bowl in history. the game\\'s MVP was Linebacker Richard Dent.  the team was characterized by \"Punky QB\" Jim McMahon, \"The Refrigator\" William Perry, and Steve McMicheal. The team\\'s swagger was cemented by \"The Superbowl Shuffle,\" a music video made by the team that became a huge hit on the music charts.

Lake Clifton Eastern High School was built sometime in the 1970s. It is currently the largest and newest school in the entire city. It\\'s been said that Lake Clifton Eastern High School is the largest high school in terms of physical size on the East Coast. When Lake Clifton first opened, it was said that it was the largest high school in the entire nation. Lake Clifton Eastern obtained its name through a place location and from another school. When Lake Clifton Eastern High School first opened, it was simply known as Lake Clifton High School, the school was built on top of a lake known as Lake Clifton, there are some fears in the current time that the school is sinking each year due to the fact the school was built on top of a lake. In 1985, Eastern High School moved into Lake Clifton and merged with Lake Clifton, the Baltimore City School Board decided to change the name to Lake Clifton Eastern High School to reflect Eastern\\'s merge with Lake Clifton. In 1997 a electrical fire destroyed the library of Lake Clifton Eastern High School, soon after, a state of the art media center was built. Lake Clifton\\'s library is the newest in the whole city. Lake Clifton\\'s sports teams (as of the 2002-2003 school year) included wrestling, swimming, track and field, basketball, football, and tennis. A decision was made in 2003 by the city school board to split up Lake Clifton into a smaller school, a trend that is occuring throughout the city school system with large high schools.
